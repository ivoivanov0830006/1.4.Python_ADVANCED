------------------------------------ Problem to resolve --------------------------------

Write a function called stock_availability which receives:
an inventory list of boxes with different kinds of cupcake flavours
"delivery" or "sell" as second parameter
there might or might not be any other parameters â€“ numbers or strings at the end

In case of "delivery"  to the shop was delivered new boxes with diferent kinds of cupcakes:
You should add the boxes at the end of the inventory list
There will be always at least one box delivered
In case of "sell" Maria has a client and she is selling different boxes with cupcakes:
If there is a number as another parameter, it means that Maria has sold that many boxes with cupcakes 
and you should remove them from the beginning of the inventory list
    * If there is/are string/s as another parameter/s, it means that Maria has sold ALL cupcake boxes 
    of the ordered flavour/s. Beware that not everything the buyer has ordered might be in stock, so you 
    should check if the order is valid.  
    * If there are no other parameters, it means that Maria has sold only the first box of cupcakes and 
    you should remove  it of the inventory list
For more clarifications, see the examples below.
Input
There will be no input
Parameters will be passed to your function
Output
The function should return a new inventory list
All commands will be valid

Test Code
print(stock_availability(["choco", "vanilla", "banana"], "delivery", "caramel", "berry"))
print(stock_availability(["chocolate", "vanilla", "banana"], "delivery", "cookie","banana"))
print(stock_availability(["chocolate", "vanilla", "banana"], "sell"))
print(stock_availability(["chocolate", "vanilla", "banana"], "sell", 3))
print(stock_availability(["chocolate", "chocolate", "banana"], "sell", "chocolate"))
print(stock_availability(["cookie", "chocolate", "banana"], "sell", "chocolate"))
print(stock_availability(["chocolate", "vanilla", "banana"], "sell", "cookie"))
Output
['choco', 'vanilla', 'banana', 'caramel', 'berry']
['chocolate', 'vanilla', 'banana', 'cookie', 'banana']
['vanilla', 'banana']
[]
['banana']
['cookie', 'banana']
['chocolate', 'vanilla', 'banana']
